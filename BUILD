REQUIREMENTS:

You will need either GNU, Allegro, CMU, or Lucid Common Lisp to run
NESL.  CMU and GNU Common Lisp are available for free.  See the FTP site
at ftp://ftp.ma.utexas.edu/pub/gcl/ for information on GCL, or email
slisp@cs.cmu.edu for information on CMU CL.  You will also need a
Unix-like operating system (SunOS, AIX, HP-UX, Ultrix, Mach and Unicos
work fine).

For the full NESL release you will also need an C compiler, lex, yacc,
and if you want the graphics routines, an X11 library.

HOW TO BUILD NESL:

The following steps should be sufficient to build a version of NESL
to run on your local workstation.

  o Run "make" from the top-level NESL directory.  This builds CVL,
    VCODE, and xneslplot, leaving "vinterp.serial" and "xneslplot" in
    the "bin" directory.

  o Start a Common Lisp in the top-level Nesl directory, and enter: 
       (load "neslsrc/build.lisp")

  o Follow the instructions for dumping an executable version
    of Nesl.  This will create a file "bin/runnesl", which can
    be executed directly to start up NESL.

If you have problems, or for further details, see the user's manual in
doc/user.ps.
